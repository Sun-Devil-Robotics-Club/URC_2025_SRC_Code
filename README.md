sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros2-control
sudo apt install ros-humble-controller-manager
sudo apt install ros-humble-robot-state-publisher
sudo apt install ros-humble-xacro
sudo apt install ros-humble-rviz2
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-plugins
sudo apt install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui
```

### 4. Zed 2 Dependencies

```
## ü§ù How to Collaborate

### 1. Setup Your ROS 2 Workspace
- Create a ROS 2 workspace if you haven't already, with a `src` directory.
- Navigate to the `src` directory and clone the repository:
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/Sun-Devil-Robotics-Club/URC_2025_SRC_Code.git .
```

### 2. Create and Work on a New Branch
- Create a new branch (replace `<branch_name>` with your desired branch name):
```
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```
- Make and save your changes, then stage them:
```
git add .
```
- Commit your changes (replace `<your_message>` with a meaningful commit message):
```
git commit -m "<your_message>"
```
- Push your changes to the repository:
```
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### 3. Open a Pull Request
After pushing your changes, go to the GitHub repository and open a pull request. Your changes will be reviewed by the team and, if approved, merged into the main codebase.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Your Environment

Once your ROS 2 workspace is set up, ensure you have a file structure that has `<workspace_name>\src` and that all of the packages in this repository are present in the `src` directory.

- Navigate to your ROS 2 workspace directory:
```
cd <workspace_name>
```
- Then run colcon build (ensure this is run from your ROS 2 workspace, not the `src` directory):
```
colcon build
```

If any errors arise, you are likely missing some dependencies, so make sure you have followed the installation commands mentioned above.

## üöÄ Run Example Simulation

1. Source your workspace:
```
source ~/<workspace_name>/install/setup.bash
```
2. Start the simulation and RViz in a terminal. You should see a world populated with objects and the robot:
```
ros2 launch sdrc_bringup sdrc_gazebo.launch.py use_ros2_control:=false
```
3. To control the rover, run the following command. This will bring up a control pad in the terminal, allowing you to control the rover using `u,i,o,j,k,l,m,",",".","/":
```
ros2 teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
